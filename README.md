### PTgen

Create and evaluate probabilistic transcriptions (PT's) of speech recordings
generated by mismatched crowds, i.e., by many people who do not speak
that recording's language.

### How to build on Ubuntu

Install [OpenFST](http://www.openfst.org/) and [carmel](http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/carmel).

After checking out the repository, from the top directory:

`cd src; make`

### How to create and test PT's

Edit the settings file, e.g. `settings_sample`.

Set `startstage=1`.

Make sure all the required files within `$DATA` exist.

`run.sh settings_sample`

If you encounter errors and fix them, you can resume `run.sh` partway through
by changing `startstage` to a value larger than 1.
