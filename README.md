# PTgen

Acquire and evaluate probabilistic transcriptions (PT's) of speech recordings
generated by *mismatched crowdsourcing:* by many people
who don't know the recordings' language.

The technique is described in this [ICASSP paper](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/pubs/2016/liu16icassp.pdf),
this [AAAI paper](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~pjyothi/files/AAAI2015.pdf),
and without jargon in this [Technograph article](Technograph.md).
<!-- (http://dailyillini.com/special-sections/2016/04/10/researchers-developing-an-automatic-speech-recognition-software-for-under-resourced-languages/) -->

The theory is described in sections II.C, III.B, and V of this [IEEE TASLP paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7707303/).

A stage-by-stage description is found in this [Interspeech paper](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/pubs/2015/jyothi15interspeech_mismatch.pdf).

# How to build on Ubuntu

Install [OpenFST](http://www.openfst.org/), [Carmel](http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/carmel), and at least the `compute-wer` executable of [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi).

```
git clone https://github.com/uiuc-sst/PTgen
cd src
make
```

The first time you `make`, you'll be asked to enter the directory of OpenFST's file `fst/compat.h`.
This is usually `/usr/local/include`.  If it isn't, then `rm config.mk; make` and
instead try a result from the command `locate fst/compat.h`.

# How to get crowdsourced transcriptions

See the subdirectory [mturk](./mturk).

# How to create and evaluate PT's

Edit the settings file, e.g. [`test/2016-08-24/settings`](test/2016-08-24/settings).
- Ensure that the required files within that file's `$DATA` exist,
or can be downloaded from that file's `$DATA_URL` (because they're too big for github).

If you're using [MCASR](https://github.com/uiuc-sst/mcasr), in the settings file set `mcasr=1`.

If needed, split the transcriptions into [train/dev/eval sets](datasplit.md).

Process the PT's: `run.sh settings`.

If `run.sh` can't find the executable programs of OpenFST, Carmel, or Kaldi, it asks for their locations,
and remembers your answers in a file `config.sh`.

If you encounter errors and fix them, you can save time by starting `run.sh` partway through:
in the settings file, set `startstage` to one past your last successfully completed stage.

# How to run prebuilt tests

`cd test/ws15` (or any other test directory).

`../../run.sh settings-foo`

If `../../run.sh` asks again where to find exes, just abort it with `ctrl+C`, retrieve those settings with `cp ../../config.sh .`, and rerun.
