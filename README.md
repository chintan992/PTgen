# PTgen

Create and evaluate probabilistic transcriptions (PT's) of speech recordings
generated by mismatched crowdsourcing, i.e., by a large number of people
who do not speak that recording's language.

The technique is described in this [AAAI paper](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~pjyothi/files/AAAI2015.pdf).

# How to build on Ubuntu

Install [OpenFST](http://www.openfst.org/) and [carmel](http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/carmel).

`git clone https://github.com/ws15code/PTgen`
`cd src`
`make`

# How to create and test PT's

Edit the settings file, e.g. `settings_sample`.

Set `startstage=1`.

Make sure all the required files within `$DATA` exist.

`run.sh settings_sample`

If you encounter errors and fix them, you can resume `run.sh` partway through
by changing `startstage` to a value larger than 1.
